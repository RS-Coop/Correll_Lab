# Neural Networks for Microcontrollers: Python

This is a python implementation of Neural Networks for Microcontrollers (nn4mc) (originally implemented in C++) that allows for the translation of trained neural network models to C code for use in embedded systems.

### Development Status

Please note that nn4mc_py is still in development and may have many bugs. We are working hard on getting everything operating seamlessly, and feel free to reach out with any questions.

### Using nn4mc

First note that you import this package using the name "nn4mc_py", so as to differentiate between other nn4mc implementations.
